<p><strong>Update (2020-04-19):</strong> 4-bit Webther is no longer available; the Yahoo! Weather API is no more.
The links to it here have been removed, but the remainder of the post&rsquo;s text has been left
untouched.</p>

<p>4-bit Weather was something I started last semester break for fun - it was a simple .NET application that took in a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/guide/concepts.html">Yahoo! WOEID</a> and spat out four indicators of the weather conditions at that location: hot/cold, rainy/sunny, windy/still, and humid/arid.</p>
<p>While the basic (and let&rsquo;s face it, it is pretty basic) functionality was there, I didn&rsquo;t get around to developing it to a state where I&rsquo;d consider it complete. You had to manually look up your WOEID somewhere else if you didn&rsquo;t know it, then plug it in (though thankfully once that was done the application would remember it for you) - ideally, you&rsquo;d just type in a location, and the application would figure everything out on its own.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p><a href="./">4-bit Webther</a> is the same concept, rebuilt for an entirely different platform: the web. It took significantly less time to write (one and a half days, on and off) than 4-bit Weather did, in part because I&rsquo;d used the Yahoo! Weather API before (which, as it returns an RSS feed, required some parsing) but switched to using <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/">YQL</a> this time (which returns JSON instead: perfect and easy to work with in a JavaScript application.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a lot easier to use - if you allow it to (and your browser supports it), it uses HTML5 Geolocation to get your location. If not, just type the place you want a weather forecast for, and it&rsquo;ll look it up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it. 4-bit Webther gives a glance-able overview of the weather: nothing more, nothing less. The only thing left would be to add a way to save preferences - the starting location, units (km/h and C versus mi/h and F), and the various thresholds used to determine what value each &ldquo;bit&rdquo; should have.</p>

      <p>19:56, December 22nd 2013, London.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> the first time I&rsquo;ve been here, though it might as well be. It&rsquo;s been twenty years or so since we left, and I can&rsquo;t actually remember anything about the place. There were one or two memories I thought I&rsquo;d held on to, though actually visiting the locations within revealed them to be false - something I&rsquo;d suspected for a while, anyway.</p>
<p>Winter. We arrived earlier in the week at just after three in the afternoon, and it looked like it should&rsquo;ve been seven or eight instead; nights start at around four or five. It encourages an earlier end to the day, and a corresponding earlier start, though that&rsquo;s something that only really applies if you have the luxury of a flexible schedule. The cold weather is a nice change, and it&rsquo;s humid and/or wet enough for there not to be any static, one of the few annoyances I do remember about winter in general.</p>
<p>A lot of these thoughts pretty much just come about from living in a place with just two seasons: &ldquo;hot&rdquo;, and &ldquo;warm, with rain&rdquo;.</p>
<hr>
<p>I caught Pacific Rim on the flight over. It didn&rsquo;t seem interesting enough to warrant watching in cinemas when it came out, though the praise for it online made me curious. It was decent enough, I suppose. I do like the soundtrack - Ramin Djawadi composes some pretty good ones: Iron Man, the recent Medal of Honor games.</p>
<p>Finished reading All You Need is Kill during the second half of the flight, which was a really good book, and started reading Clean Code after that. Dreamt about refactoring and/or writing code over the next few nights.</p>
<hr>
<p>We brought a point-and-shoot camera along - a Canon Powershot S95 - but it ended up going unused for the most part. We just used our smartphones instead.</p>
<p>The image quality of the Powershot could be better than that of both the phones in question (a Samsung Galaxy Note III and a Nokia Lumia 920), but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to feel like we were losing out on anything by not using it. The phones were much more convenient to carry and use, and were <em>good enough</em> - they had past the point below which the superior alternative was clearly a better choice. (Though I&rsquo;m reasonably certain that the Lumia 920&rsquo;s low-light performance is much better than that of the Powershot.)</p>
<p>Something that occasionally worries me: that something perceived as being <em>good enough</em> becomes so popular that the market kills off the superior alternative. Highly subjective, of course.</p>
<hr>
<p>ComfortDelGro owns one of the bus operators here.</p>
<p>That was a surprise. It&rsquo;s pretty cool that the buses all have a uniform look and feel, despite being operated by different companies.</p>
<p>There are pre-recorded announcements on all the buses. There&rsquo;s one after the doors close, saying the service number and destination. There&rsquo;s one before every stop, announcing its name. Incredibly useful features to have.</p>
<p>The buses in Munich have the stop name announcements as well. It&rsquo;d be great if they made their way to Singapore.</p>
<hr>
<p>One night, we were on a bus which encountered a road diversion along its route.</p>
<p>The diversion pointed traffic down a side road which appeared (to the driver, at least) much too small for a bus to turn into.</p>
<p>A twenty minute, unplanned, entirely off-route detour ensued.</p>
<hr>
<p>On another night, the hotel fire alarm went off just past midnight. There was a test of the fire alarm earlier that day, so we at least knew what the sound was when it happened. (It ended up being a false alarm.)</p>
<p>The fire service showed up incredibly quickly - a minute or so after we&rsquo;d reached the ground floor, or less than five minutes after the alarm first started.</p>
<p>As with almost everywhere else we&rsquo;ve been, traffic actually scrambles to move out of the way of emergency vehicles here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be nice to have in Singapore, too.</p>

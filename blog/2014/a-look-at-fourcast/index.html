    <div class="post-body">
      <p><em>It&rsquo;s been almost two years since Fourcast launched. I thought it&rsquo;d be fun to look at how much it&rsquo;s
changed since then, and talk about how it&rsquo;ll change soon.</em></p>
<p>Fourcast started out looking quite different.</p>
<figure><img src="./images/4bitwebther.png"

<p>4-bit Webther<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was Fourcast&rsquo;s predecessor of sorts - a simple website that broke down the weather into the same four components: temperature, condition, wind, and humidity. It used Yahoo! Weather for data, and adhered pretty firmly to the Boolean nature of each &ldquo;bit&rdquo;, except for Rain/Shine (which had five values: Rain, Snow, Shine, &ldquo;Rain&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Shine&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>Fourcast came about shortly after completing 4-bit Webther. I wanted to build something for Windows Phone, but had no ideas apart from just porting what I&rsquo;d just finished. It was carrying on the tradition: 4-bit Webther itself was a port from a C# desktop app to the web, since I wanted to build something in JS and had no other ideas.</p>
<p>I decided to drop Yahoo! Weather and use Weather Underground&rsquo;s data instead, since at the time there weren&rsquo;t any other weather apps on Windows Phone which used it. The initial mock-up looked like this.</p>
<figure><img src="./images/1.jpg"
    alt="Screenshot of the initial Fourcast prototype.">
</figure>

<p>It was basically just a copy of the 4-bit Webther UI, vertically-arranged so it&rsquo;d fit the phone&rsquo;s portrait orientation. It&rsquo;s kind of cringey to look at now.</p>
<p>The first working version to actually retrieve data (instead of just display hard-coded values) wasn&rsquo;t much better.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<figure><img src="./images/2.jpg"
    alt="Screenshot of an early Fourcast prototype.">
</figure>

<p>If I recall correctly, the main reason I arranged things in this grid was because I couldn&rsquo;t get the vertical arrangement to fit horizontally in landscape. Landscape support got dropped along the way, but the grid stuck.</p>
<p>At this point there still wasn&rsquo;t a whole lot going on. There wasn&rsquo;t a way to search for locations - the weather data wasn&rsquo;t hard-coded any more, but the location to look up was. You were only able to see the conditions <em>right now</em>, which wasn&rsquo;t very useful on its own.</p>
<p>The coloured background of each box actually stayed in for quite a while, even as the rest of the design changed. It used the phone&rsquo;s accent colour, which I thought was an easy way of adding some variety to the look. Whenever I showed the app to someone, though, they&rsquo;d invariably end up tapping on the boxes to see if anything happened. I dropped the colours, and the tapping stopped.</p>
<p>Almost a month after that, Fourcast launched on the Windows Phone Store. It started off with a version number of v0.2, the unreleased work-in-progress versions making up &ldquo;v0.1&rdquo;.</p>
<figure><img src="./images/3.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the first version of Fourcast to be released.">
</figure>

<p>The headers were replaced with more informative (and general) text, and things were laid out a little better.</p>
<p>Things looked the same for two months, until I received a request to add the Dew Point to the Humidity box. While doing that, a couple of other changes ended up being bundled in at the same time, making v0.6.</p>
<figure><img src="./images/4.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Fourcast, with Dew Point added.">
</figure>

<p>The dew point slotted neatly beneath the relative humidity value, making it fit in more with the other three elements. A little link that brought up a map of the weather station&rsquo;s location was added, and the search icon was changed from a globe to the standard magnifying glass.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;later&rdquo; forecast tab also became &ldquo;tonight&rdquo;. I noticed that the time for that forecast seemed to always be 11 PM, and thought it meant the forecast was for the evening; the change was because it wouldn&rsquo;t have been &ldquo;later&rdquo; if you looked at it past 11 PM. This in itself was a misunderstanding, though we&rsquo;ll look at that a bit later.</p>
<p>Just over a year later, v1.0 shook things up a little.</p>
<figure><img src="./images/5.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the 1.0 redesign of Fourcast">
</figure>

<p>The white border on each element disappeared. I didn&rsquo;t think they added much, and they started to seem a little out of place. Inspired by the <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/store/app/battery-pro/a11aae5a-b595-4a87-ae4d-9dea0de375d1">Battery Pro+</a> app, the headers became capitalised and centred - I&rsquo;d been toying with capitalising them before, but hadn&rsquo;t figured out how to do it in a way that looked okay.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Forecast Time&rdquo; and &ldquo;Weather Station&rdquo; headers were also cut. I figured they weren&rsquo;t actually necessary, since seeing the information on its own would be self-explanatory. (I didn&rsquo;t yet think the same of the headers for each element.) Since station names could get pretty long, I couldn&rsquo;t just place the &ldquo;(Map)&rdquo; link next to them as it might end up appearing off-screen; this was why it ended up next to the header in the first place. The easy solution was to just make the station name itself the link.</p>
<p>The goal was to make things look cleaner and, as a result, nicer. I don&rsquo;t know how well the latter was achieved, though I did like it enough to actually go and release it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Fourcast v1.2 may end up being the last version to support Windows Phone 7.5/7.8, assuming I don&rsquo;t accidentally introduce any bugs which completely break things. It <a href="/blog/2014/Fourcast-1-1-1.html">wouldn&rsquo;t</a> be the <a href="/blog/2012/that-fourcast-crash-bug.html">first time</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things I&rsquo;d like to improve before leaving this side of the platform behind for Windows Phone 8. Tiles are one; the UI is another.</p>
<p>Fourcast&rsquo;s been entirely textual up until this point. I think in some way that adds to its simplicity, though I&rsquo;d been wondering if it might look better with some simple icons.</p>
<p>It came close to looking like this.</p>
<figure><img src="./images/6.png"
    alt="Screenshot of a prototype vertical redesign of Fourcast.">
</figure>

<p>The weather station is now above the forecast pivot - it seemed silly to have it scroll off and on again when you changed the date. There&rsquo;s also some text leading in to the forecast date and time, which feels more pleasant than just dumping the information there without context.</p>
<p>The second forecast&rsquo;s label has changed yet again, from &ldquo;tonight&rdquo; to &ldquo;today&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d been misinterpreting the data Weather Underground was giving all along - the time portion of future forecasts isn&rsquo;t actually relevant at all; only the date is. As with the last time, the only change here is to the label itself.</p>
<p>I did like how the headers spaced things out, but they also end up obstructing things somewhat. They were originally in 4-bit Webther to illustrate the Boolean, either-or nature of things, and stuck around because things looked out of place without them. I think we&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where they can be removed without loss of any information, and the coloured icons prevent things from looking plain without them.</p>

    alt="Screenshot of the final redesign of Fourcast.">
</figure>

<p>With them gone, it&rsquo;s possible to just scan down the entire column without being interrupted, and things are a little more compact. I might end up tweaking the spacing a little, but I&rsquo;m happy with the way this looks for now.</p>

<p>Seeing the misaligned &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; line really bugs me now. Alignment in general wasn&rsquo;t
something I thought about until actually looking over the Windows Phone design documents, and now I

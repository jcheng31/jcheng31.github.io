      <p>While updating <a href="https://jcheng31.github.io/isitonspotify/">Is it on Spotify?</a> to use the new(ish)
Spotify Web API, I ran into an issue when testing things out locally.</p>

<p>The good old <em>Cross-Origin Request Blocked</em>. I seemed to remember having the same issue when first writing the app, though it was solved by just throwing jQuery at the problem. So why was it back now?</p>
<p>Even stranger, the problem only occurred when running locally. Everything worked fine when the app was served from GitHub Pages, which was the opposite of what I found when I searched online: everyone else seemed to only have issues after deploying to their server, despite things working locally.</p>
<p>I thought it had might somehow have something to do with the way I was hosting it locally - just using Python&rsquo;s <code>SimpleHTTPServer</code> - though switching to <code>node-serve</code> or even Jekyll&rsquo;s <code>serve</code> (heh) didn&rsquo;t make a difference.</p>
<p>After some more fruitless searching, I decided on a whim to fire up Internet Explorer 11 and check out the F12 Developer Tools (which <del>are, funnily enough, no longer</del> totally are bound to the actual F12 key). That gave an interesting series of messages, instead of just the one that Firefox Aurora did:</p>

    alt="Screenshot of IE11 F12 Developer Tools showing CORS errors.">
</figure>

<p>The second message - <code>Redirect was blocked for CORS request.</code> - was a little puzzling. Clicking on the <code>SEC7127</code> error code lead to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn423949">this page</a>, which had a pretty big hint:</p>

    alt="Screenshot of MSDN documentation showing an explanation of error code SEC7127 - &#34;The path to the CORS resource contained a redirect that violated security rules.&#34;">
</figure>

<p>That was the light-bulb moment: when I&rsquo;d updated the API endpoint URL in the code, I&rsquo;d left out the protocol (just as I did when using the old Metadata API), and so the request would just end up using whatever the app had been loaded over: HTTPS when on GitHub Pages, and plain HTTP locally. It turns out that the Spotify API is served through HTTPS, though making a request to it over HTTP results in a &ldquo;correction&rdquo; by means of a redirect.</p>
<p>A redirect that ended up being blocked for security reasons by the browser.</p>
<p>And so everything worked fine when deployed, but not locally.</p>
<p>The fix was simple - just changing the URL in the code to include HTTPS at the start.</p>
<p>Thanks, IE.</p>

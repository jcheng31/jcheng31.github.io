<p><strong>Update (2020-04-19):</strong> Is it on Spotify? is still online, though it no longer works. All of the
links to it here have been left intact regardless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While at a caf√© with some friends, I heard bits and pieces of a song over the stereo - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bmp4QWzHak">this
song</a>. It sounded pretty nice, so after finding out
what it was (in a roundabout manner<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>) I starred it on Spotify.</p>
<p>This probably won&rsquo;t come as a surprise, given the title of this piece: a week or so later, it disappeared from the service.</p>
<p>I was wondering if it&rsquo;d been completely pulled from the catalogue (unlikely, since the same artist had other tracks which were still up), and if not, where in the world it was still available. I also knew that the Spotify <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/web-api/">Metadata API</a> let you look up a track&rsquo;s information, which also included its availability.</p>
<p>I searched around for a bit, but couldn&rsquo;t find anything which would just take a track name, and tell you where it could be heard. I did come across this <a href="https://www.quora.com/Spotify/What-website-lists-Spotify-music-availability-per-country?">Quora post</a> from 2012 which suggested calling the API directly in the browser:</p>

</figure>

<p>Which definitely works, but eh. It&rsquo;s not the most convenient thing to do.</p>
<p>So, one Saturday later, here we are: a website to do just that.

<p>Type in a track, hit Enter, and get an answer.</p>

<p>You can also change tracks if the first search result wasn&rsquo;t the one you were looking for by clicking on the name (if it&rsquo;s underlined), and see the exact regions by clicking on the number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the prettiest, but at least it beats JSON ;)</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://jcheng31.github.io/isitonspotify/">here</a>, and (if you want) poke around the code <a href="https://github.com/jcheng31/isitonspotify">here.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>My initial guess was correct: the song hadn&rsquo;t actually been removed entirely, though it&rsquo;s only available in the US, Canada, and Australia. Other tracks are available in many more regions, though.</p>
<p>Wish I knew how these licensing things work.</p>

<p>We were far away enough and the ambient sound was loud enough that I wasn&rsquo;t confident that my phone would be able to identify it. I asked a friend if he happened to know what it was, and he walked over and asked someone he knew who worked there. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

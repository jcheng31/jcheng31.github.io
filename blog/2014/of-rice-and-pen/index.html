    <div class="post-body">
      <p>Just over a week after getting it, my <a href="http://www.wacom.com/en/us/everyday/bamboo-stylus-feel">Wacom Bamboo Stylus feel</a> (which is quite a name) ended up going through the wash cycle. I&rsquo;d clipped it inside one of my cargo pockets, and forgotten to take it out.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>I tried it out immediately after realising and retrieving it, but it didn&rsquo;t work. Removing the nib revealed that there was still water inside, and a quick search revealed <a href="http://forum.tabletpcreview.com/hp-touchsmart-tm2-wacom/45456-got-pen-wet-not-working-right-anymore.html">this thread</a> - someone with a similar problem, but a different Wacom pen.</p>
<p>Two things stuck out - the way these pens actually work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is just a coil, and a small circuit board with a switch on it as well as a few tiny components; all of it is really basic, and the [electricity] for it comes from the coil being energized by the field the screen [puts] off</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, from another poster:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Seeing how you already tried it and it wasn&rsquo;t is disheartening, because if it was moist inside and you tried it, means it powered up with the moisture thus possibly shorting something inside.</strong> It couldn&rsquo;t hurt to try drying it out with rice though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t too optimistic after reading that. Though the thread creator did manage to get their own pen working again just by letting it dry out in a warm place for a bit, it hadn&rsquo;t completely died like mine: it just kept sending clicks instead. It had also just gotten a little wet, whereas mine had been positively drenched.</p>
<p>I stuck it in rice anyway, sans nib.</p>
<p>For quite a while, I actually didn&rsquo;t want to take it out again to test it. As long as it was in the bag, it was just like Schr√∂dinger&rsquo;s cat: possibly dead, but possibly working too. Testing it would remove one of those possibilities - probably the one where it still worked - and so just leaving it alone maintained that glimmer of ignorance and hope.</p>
<p>I decided to collapse the possibilities and try it today. I removed it from the bag, replaced the nib, and waved it near my laptop&rsquo;s screen.</p>
<p>Success. \o/</p>

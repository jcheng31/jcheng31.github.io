  <h1><strong>Typing Secrets in the Open</strong></h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle">Garbage out. Garbage in. Plaintext out.</h2>
</div>

    <div class="post-body">
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been keeping a daily journal for quite a while now - 8 or so years? I started using OhLife,
which was email-based, then when that shut down I moved to plain-old-Markdown files stored in a
TrueCrypt (and now VeraCrypt) container&hellip; thing.</p>
<p>One thing I had never really done was journal in public, because that would mean anyone could just read whatever I wrote. If I had to, I&rsquo;d try and put my back to a wall, and close the window whenever anyone got near. Earlier this week, though, I found myself with some time to go before a flight and wondered if there were a way I could actually write at the gate, in the open, without anyone being able to tell what I was writing.</p>
<p>I realised that I actually could, and that the method was really simple too.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;d done a few years ago was switch over to using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Colemak">Colemak</a> instead of QWERTY; I can touch type in it, too. If I were to switch my keyboard layout back into QWERTY but keep typing as if I were using Colemak, the result would be seemingly gibberish to anyone looking - I&rsquo;d just need to convert the text back later. The same technique would work with any alternative keyboard layout with enough keys that differ from QWERTY, like Dvorak: it&rsquo;s effectively a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher">substitution cipher</a>, though instead of writing plaintext and encoding it, you just write the ciphertext directly.</p>
<p>I wrote my entry, then worked on a tool to decode it. So here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/jcheng31/ColemakConverter">ColemakConverter</a>.</p>
<p>It:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is written in C#, using .NET Core.
<ul>
<li>I really like C#.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is cross-platform! Hooray!
<ul>
<li>Install .NET Core, add it to your PATH, then run <code>dotnet ColemakConverter.dll &lt;path to input file&gt; &lt;path to output file&gt;</code>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s like Java, but not!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Converts text written using QWERTY, but as if the keyboard layout was Colemak, back into plain text.
<ul>
<li>In other words: set your keyboard layout to QWERTY, type as if you were using Colemak, and this tool will convert the result into a readable form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does not have any error-handling whatsoever.
<ul>
<li>Forget to give it either an input path or an output path? It&rsquo;ll crash.</li>
<li>Give it an input path that points to something that isn&rsquo;t a text file? It&rsquo;ll probably crash.
<ul>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t actually try. But the chances are pretty good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Probably won&rsquo;t scale well to massive files.
<ul>
<li>Here&rsquo;s how it works:
<ol>
<li>Read all lines from the input file.</li>
<li>For each line, split the text into characters, convert each character, then join the converted characters into a converted string.</li>
<li>Write all lines into the output file.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s do everything in memory! \o/</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Could it be more efficient? Sure. Safer? Definitely. More general, with a file used to define the character mapping, so it&rsquo;s not just hardcoded for QWERTY and Colemak? Yeah. But this seems so incredibly niche that I doubt there&rsquo;s actually any demand for it.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m wrong, feel free to file an issue or submit a pull request!</p>

    <div class="post-body">
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to revamp this whole site for quite a while now, and it&rsquo;s finally happened. The
first commit for this iteration was made on September 24, 2018 and after an initial few days&rsquo; worth
of work it basically stagnated until today.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what we have now: <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> hosted on GitHub Pages, replacing
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> hosted on a DigitalOcean box. Deploying is running a script locally,
whereas previously it was pushing to a repository and having a Git hook fire off to trigger Jekyll
on the VPS to rebuild. I didn&rsquo;t have a good way of reproducing that set-up if it ever went down
permanently since I&rsquo;d set it up all manually, and I didn&rsquo;t like how Jekyll made my website feel like
an entire Ruby project - I had to track <code>.ruby-version</code> and Gemfile just to be able to set it up
again reliably.</p>
<p>(And go through an entire install <code>rbenv</code>, <code>rbenv install</code>, <code>bundle install</code> cycle first as well.)</p>
<p>This time around deploying is just running a script (provided in the Hugo docs, even) locally, and
it fits in source control alongside the content. There isn&rsquo;t anything to worry about
dependency-wise, too, since Hugo&rsquo;s just a single binary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fitting that, just as I started with Ruby and eventually transitioned to Go while at
work, my personal site&rsquo;s done the same.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;re no analytics of my own (I&rsquo;m not sure what if anything GitHub has on their side), and
hence no JavaScript of any sort. The CSS for this is a whole lot simpler too, since we&rsquo;re not doing
the adaptive sidebar thing any more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also finally gotten HTTPS and a Favicon.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this goes.</p>

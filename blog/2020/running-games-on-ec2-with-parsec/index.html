  <h1><strong>Running Games on EC2 with Parsec</strong></h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle">Like a LAN shop, except that it really isn&#39;t in almost every way.</h2>
</div>

    <div class="post-body">
      <p>I&rsquo;m back in Singapore and away from my desktop, which has meant not being able to play any of my
more demanding or Windows-only games on the computer I actually have here (a MacBook Pro). I gave
GeForce Now a shot, but given that they didn&rsquo;t have any servers in the region, the latency made
things quite unplayable. It also didn&rsquo;t look very good, most likely for the same reason.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="https://lg.io/2015/07/05/revised-and-much-faster-run-your-own-highend-cloud-gaming-service-on-ec2.html">this 2015 guide</a>
to running an EC2 instance for gaming via a Telegram group chat, and gave the pre-built AMI a shot. I wanted to use
<a href="https://parsecgaming.com/">Parsec</a> instead of Steam In-Home Streaming, though, since I was
interested in playing a game which <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> on Steam (and I forgot that you could just add the game
<em>to</em> Steam and play it that way). Unfortunately, out of the box, Parsec wouldn&rsquo;t work - it came back
with an error saying the encoder couldn&rsquo;t be initialised, which I guessed was because of severely
outdated graphics drivers. I didn&rsquo;t manage to get newer ones to install, so I decided to start over
from scratch, following <a href="https://medium.com/@bmatcuk/gaming-on-amazon-s-ec2-83b178f47a34">a 2016 guide</a>
instead and riffing on it to modernize things a little.</p>
<p>The result is a set-up that lets me play The Division 2 at about 50ish FPS on High-ish settings at
1440p, and XCOM: Chimera Squad at 60 FPS on maxed-out settings at the same resolution. Latency is
pretty good in that I don&rsquo;t notice it at all, though when playing The Division 2 I get occasional
issues where everything freezes before catching up; this literally happens to me on my actual
desktop too, though, so I&rsquo;m not too fussed there. Maybe it&rsquo;s just that game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not the exact same in terms of visual fidelity as playing on identical settings on a
&ldquo;real&rdquo; machine in front of you - it&rsquo;s a little bit off since you&rsquo;re pretty much watching a video of
the game running - but it&rsquo;s still better than nothing, and the difference isn&rsquo;t that jarring.</p>
<p>The cost of running this varies based on the bandwidth needed to stream and how long you play - any
games which have a lot of motion going on will be higher-bandwidth than ones which are relatively
static, and your resolution is going to affect this too. It seems to have come out to approximately
a (US) dollar per hour for me so far, which is close enough to what I remember the cost of going to
a LAN shop being (albeit almost two decades ago). Plus those are closed now given everything going
on in the world, and I can do this while at home.</p>
<p>So. Here&rsquo;re the steps I followed. This is again adapted from <a href="https://medium.com/@bmatcuk/gaming-on-amazon-s-ec2-83b178f47a34">this guide</a>,
which is worth checking out as well for more details on how AWS pricing works.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-instance">Creating the Instance</h2>
<ol>
<li>First, select an appropriate region within the AWS console. You&rsquo;ll probably want to use
<a href="https://www.cloudping.info">CloudPing.info</a> to find the one with the lowest latency. Since I&rsquo;m
in Singapore, I chose <code>Asia Pacific (Singapore)</code>, also known as <code>ap-southeast-1</code>.</li>
<li>In the EC2 dashboard, click either of the <code>Launch Instance</code> buttons.</li>
<li>Choose the <code>Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Base</code> AMI.</li>
<li>Filter the instance list by GPU Instances, then select a <code>g4dn.xlarge</code> instance. This is a
4-core, 16 GB RAM instance with an NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU which is (so far) good enough.</li>
<li>Tick the <code>Request Spot instances</code> button, then enter a maximum price of one cent more than the
current price shown (rounded down). As of this writing in <code>ap-southeast-1</code> the current price is
$0.4048; I would enter $0.41 here.</li>
<li>On the Add Storage screen, leave the default storage size of 30GB unchanged. We&rsquo;ll talk about
this later.</li>
<li>Skip the Add Tags step, unless you have a use for it. I didn&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Create a new security group to enable yourself to access the machine. My ISP gives out static IP
addresses, so I created one which just allows all traffic from my IP.</li>
<li>Launch the instance and connect to it. The Connect dialogue on the EC2 dashboard should provide
instructions on how to get the Windows login password using a key pair. After doing so, I used <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466?mt=12">Microsoft Remote
Desktop</a> with the
AWS-provided RDP file. If you&rsquo;re on Windows, you can use Remote Desktop (open Start, then type
<code>Remote Desktop Connection</code>) - I haven&rsquo;t tried this, though.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="setting-up-parsec">Setting up Parsec</h2>
<p>Right now we have a machine up and running, but it&rsquo;s not actually in a game-ready state. We&rsquo;ll want
to get graphics and sound drivers installed, as well as Parsec, which&rsquo;ll let us connect to it with
better latency than Remote Desktop.</p>
<ol>
<li>Parsec provides a handy <a href="https://github.com/jamesstringerparsec/Parsec-Cloud-Preparation-Tool">installation
script</a> which does all the
hard work for us. Follow the instructions there and log in to Parsec when it&rsquo;s installed.</li>
<li>Open Parsec&rsquo;s settings and enable x265 streaming under the Host tab (and do the same on your
computer, under Client). This&rsquo;ll make things look better while using less bandwidth, which is
great for us. You may also want to tweak the Bandwidth Limit if you find things look a little
blocky when playing (later), or if you don&rsquo;t mind trading off some visual quality for less cost
(or the other way around). I bumped mine from the default 10 mbps to 30.</li>
<li>After running the GPU updater and rebooting the instance, check that you can reconnect using
Parsec on your own computer - the instance should pop up there after a couple of minutes. <strong>Do
not</strong> use Remote Desktop to connect first; if you do, you&rsquo;ll have to reboot again in order for
Parsec to work.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you can also go ahead and install the game store of your choice - Steam, uPlay,
Origin, etc. Even Epic if you want. Whatever works for you.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-an-ami-of-our-own">Preparing an AMI of Our Own</h2>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re not going to keep the instance up all the time, we&rsquo;ll prepare an AMI that&rsquo;ll let us
create a new one with everything set up just the way we have it now.</p>
<p>The aforementioned guide I was basing this off of said to do this before installing any games, which
gives us a clean slate AMI - you&rsquo;d then create a new AMI for each game you want to play (after
installing it). This is to help keep costs down, since you&rsquo;re charged for EBS storage based on the
size of the instance&rsquo;s disk while it&rsquo;s running. Having game-specific AMIs with smaller disks means
you pay less than if you have all your games in a single one with a large disk.</p>
<p>Interestingly, and at least according to the same guide, storage of the AMI itself is charged
somewhat differently: you&rsquo;re only charged for actual data being used and not the size of the disk.
You also only pay for the delta between the base AMI and the child one - in our case here, we&rsquo;d pay
only for the size difference between what&rsquo;s on disk in our current &ldquo;base gaming&rdquo; AMI and Amazon&rsquo;s
<code>Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Base</code> one, as well as the difference between our game AMIs and the
&ldquo;base gaming&rdquo; one<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For now, we&rsquo;ll just create the base AMI and we&rsquo;ll talk more about creating game-specific ones
later.</p>
<ol>
<li>Back in the EC2 dashboard, right click the running instance, select <code>Image</code>, then click <code>Create Image</code>. Give it an appropriate name (I called mine <code>Base Gaming VM</code> just like the other guide).</li>
<li>Terminate the instance and wait. You don&rsquo;t have to have the instance running while an AMI is
being built from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<h2 id="installing-games">Installing Games</h2>
<p>To install a game, we&rsquo;re going to go through most of the same steps that we went through to create
the first instance, though we don&rsquo;t need to go through setting everything up again.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <code>Launch Instance</code>.</li>
<li>Select the AMI you just created from <code>My AMIs</code>.</li>
<li>Select the <code>g4dn.xlarge</code> instance type.</li>
<li>Choose <code>Request Spot instances</code> and type in an appropriate max price.</li>
<li>On the <code>Add Storage</code> screen, increase the size of the <code>Root</code> volume to an appropriate size to
be able to store your game.</li>
<li>Skip the <code>Add Tags</code> screen again, or if you have a use for it, do what you want to do here.</li>
<li>Choose the security group you created before.</li>
<li>Launch the instance and connect to it using Parsec when it appears there.</li>
<li>Hit Start and type <code>Disk Management</code>, then select the <code>Create and format hard disk partitions</code>
option.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll be prompted to initialize something or another. Accept.</li>
<li>Right-click the existing <code>C:/</code> drive, then select <code>Extend Volume</code>. By default it <em>should</em> opt to
fill all the remaining space, so all you should need to do here is confirm. (If it doesn&rsquo;t,
adjust the options so it does.)</li>
<li>Install your game.</li>
</ol>
<p>You&rsquo;ll then want to go through the AMI creation process again, this time creating an AMI specific to
the game. I name mine with the date and the name of the game (e.g. <code>2020-04-27 Division 2</code>). You&rsquo;ll
also have to create a new AMI each time something on disk changes that you want to persist through
to the next time you launch an instance. For most modern games with cloud save, this will just be
every time the game is patched (so as to avoid having to repatch each time); for older ones without,
you&rsquo;ll have to do this every time you&rsquo;re done playing as well unless you want to lose all your
progress. If you upgrade the GPU drivers, it&rsquo;s the same deal.</p>
<p>When you do create an &ldquo;updated game&rdquo; AMI, you&rsquo;ll want to deregister the old one and delete the
associated snapshot so you don&rsquo;t keep paying for them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <code>AMIs</code> page under <code>Images</code> on the left side bar.</li>
<li>Right-click the old AMI and select <code>Deregister</code>.</li>
<li>Click on <code>Snapshots</code> on the left sidebar, under <code>Elastic Block Store</code>.</li>
<li>Find the snapshot you want to delete, then right-click it and select <code>Delete</code>. Usually the
creation timestamp is good enough to be able to figure out which snapshot is the correct one, but
you can also cross-reference the AMI ID in the description if you&rsquo;re having trouble (make a note
of that before deregistering the AMI!)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="actually-playing">Actually Playing</h2>
<p>Go through the same steps as the previous section, but choose the game&rsquo;s AMI instead. You don&rsquo;t need
to tweak storage, go through Disk Management, or install the game again. Connect using Parsec once
the machine pops up there and start playing.</p>
<hr>
<p>One disadvantage of us running a Windows spot instance is that as of this writing, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-interruptions.html#billing-for-interrupted-spot-instances">AWS charges for
the entire hour of usage instead of doing per-second billing like Linux spot
instances.</a>
Which means that if you play for a little over an hour and terminate the instance, you&rsquo;re still
getting billed for two full hours.</p>
<p>Exactly like a LAN shop, I suppose. There might be a way to do all of this on Linux to save even
more money, but I haven&rsquo;t tried it; Parsec doesn&rsquo;t support non-Windows hosts, so you&rsquo;d have to set
up everything manually and probably use Steam instead.</p>

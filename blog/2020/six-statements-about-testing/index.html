  <h1><strong>Six Statements About Testing</strong></h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle">Testing, 1, 2, 3. And 4 and 5 and 6.</h2>
</div>

    <div class="post-body">
      <p>I volunteered to do a learning lab session on testing at work; there were some common patterns and
things I noticed we were doing when writing tests which I thought we could be doing better.</p>
<p>Instead of just coming up with an internal-only presentation that would never see the light of day
outside the company (or just the immediate team, even), I thought it might be fun(???) to write
a couple of blog posts instead and later convert those into a presentation. The first one&rsquo;d be about
general observations/things to think about, while the second one would cover Go-specific things we
could do.</p>
<p>This is the first of those two posts. The second one is <a href="https://www.ayulin.net/blog/2020/tips-to-take-table-tests-to-the-top/">here</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This is all, of course, hugely opinionated. It&rsquo;s also not intended to be a criticism of anyone.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-testing-isnt-the-most-fun-thing-to-do">1. Testing isn&rsquo;t the most fun thing to do.</h2>
<p>Why do we write tests? The short answer is probably that we&rsquo;ve been told it&rsquo;s The Right Thing To Do,
and not because we really want to.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re told this when learning - whether you&rsquo;ve come from a CS degree, a bootcamp, or picked things
up on your own or otherwise, chances are that when learning about software engineering you&rsquo;ve been
told that testing is Good. Testing helps reduce bugs, bugs are Bad, therefore we should write tests.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re told this at work, too, usually. It&rsquo;s part of the performance criteria, everyone else is writing them or saying to and they&rsquo;ve been doing this whole engineering
thing for a while, so I guess it&rsquo;s a good idea if I write some tests too.</p>
<p>But testing&rsquo;s not glamorous. Tests don&rsquo;t deliver business value in an obvious way - it&rsquo;s unlikely
that a product manager or customer is going to come to you and request that you write them. It&rsquo;s
unlikely that you&rsquo;re getting an Exceeds Expectations or a promotion because you wrote a lot of
tests. So we write them because it&rsquo;s just what you have to do, because we&rsquo;ve been told it&rsquo;s The
Right Thing To Do and we <em>know</em> that, but in the end they&rsquo;re a chore to get through as part of the
process.</p>
<p>Even if testing <em>is</em> a net positive thing to have if done well, I think it&rsquo;s still okay to
acknowledge that it just straight up isn&rsquo;t much fun for most folks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-tests-dont-get-code-reviewed-but-they-should">2. Tests don&rsquo;t get code reviewed, but they should.</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll definitely be called out at work for adding an entire feature without any tests, but for the
most part if there&rsquo;s <em>something</em> there that passes?</p>
<p>LGTM, stamped, ship it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quote-unquote funny that one thing that&rsquo;s been common to each of the jobs I&rsquo;ve had
so far is that tests don&rsquo;t get as much attention at code review time (or any time, really) as
the feature code that&rsquo;s being shipped alongside. It&rsquo;s noticeable both online and in person: test
code rarely gets commented on and is often scrolled past in the same way that generated code is.</p>
<p>Tests are just code. It&rsquo;s code that&rsquo;s supposed to check that our feature code does what we want
it to. That means we should be checking that it&rsquo;s <em>actually</em> doing so.</p>
<p>That means looking at tests during code review<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-tests-dont-make-your-code-correct">3. Tests don&rsquo;t make your code correct.</h2>
<p>You might say that tests make sure your code is correct, but that&rsquo;s just what we <em>want</em> them to do.
What they <em>actually</em> do is make sure the code does what the test is checking for. If it&rsquo;s checking
the wrong thing, then hey. Tests pass; your code&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>How many times have you written code, wrote some tests, and later discovered a bug or an edge case
you hadn&rsquo;t handled? Or found that some code wasn&rsquo;t behaving the way it was supposed to, and that
incorrect behaviour was included as a test case?</p>
<p>Tests only do what you write them to do.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-coverage-doesnt-mean-anything">4. Coverage doesn&rsquo;t mean anything.</h2>
<p>How do we know if our tests are checking the right thing? Well, the answer is definitely not
coverage.</p>
<p>Low coverage is possibly-to-likely a bad thing. If a codebase has 0% coverage that&rsquo;s a big red flag
that should probably get looked at soon. But any &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; amount of coverage up to and including
100% in of itself is meaningless without knowing how that coverage was achieved. You can write tests
that hit every line of code in your code base and still test absolutely nothing of value. Hit every
execution path, leave out any assertions, and there you go. 100% coverage, none of it useful.</p>
<p>This is both extreme and contrived, so here&rsquo;s the real point: just as a test only ensures code does
what the test is checking for, coverage tautologically only ensures you&rsquo;re executing lines of code
as part of your test. It doesn&rsquo;t say anything about whether or not that code is correct. Chasing after coverage encourages writing tests which
overfit<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> to the implementation and which basically only ensure there&rsquo;re no runtime
errors.</p>
<p>Making sure your code runs is great, but that&rsquo;s not the same as making sure it&rsquo;s doing the right
thing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-test-behaviour-not-implementation">5. Test behaviour, not implementation.</h2>
<p>Testing your implementation means you&rsquo;ve tested that your code runs. It doesn&rsquo;t mean your code is
doing what it should. To do that, you need to be testing its behaviour.</p>
<p>One way to do this is often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing">black-box testing</a>
- treat the code as a black-box and ignore everything you know about how it works internally. Given
a particular set of inputs, what is the code supposed to do, and what is supposed to be returned, or
what side effects are expected?</p>
<p>You then need to think about the different types or classes of inputs you might expect -
sometimes called boundary-value analysis<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> or testing. What&rsquo;re some valid inputs to the function?
Write a test with one or two. What&rsquo;re all the invalid inputs? Write tests for each. You want to
figure out your range of accepted inputs, determine the edges of that range, and write tests that
cover the edge itself, something just outside the range on the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; side of the edge, and
something just inside on the &ldquo;right&rdquo; side.</p>
<p>For instance, say you have a function which takes a positive integer representing a user&rsquo;s age.
You&rsquo;d want to test one or two valid/&ldquo;safe&rdquo; values (say <code>24</code> or <code>65</code>), the invalid ones (<code>0</code>, <code>-1</code>),
and one that&rsquo;s barely okay (<code>1</code>).</p>
<p>Test tables in Go are perfect for this sort of test, iterating through inputs and expected values.</p>
<p>Preconditions are also inputs of a sort. Let&rsquo;s say your code is calling an external service to
retrieve some data. You&rsquo;re probably mocking that service as part of your test, so think about all
the ways it could behave. What if it returns an error? Or it doesn&rsquo;t return an error, but it returns
an empty result, or one that&rsquo;s missing some fields?</p>
<p>As an addendum to this point - you probably don&rsquo;t need to be asserting calls on every single one of
your mocks. Unless calling the thing that&rsquo;s being mocked is an explicit part of the expected
behaviour of your code, asserting that the mock is being called is more checking-for-implementation.
I think this is more subjective than any of the other points I&rsquo;m trying to make here, though, so
YMMV even further.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-done-well-tests-can-be-like-documentation">6. Done well, tests can be like documentation.</h2>
<p>Note that I didn&rsquo;t say they can <strong>be</strong> documentation. In no way is a set of tests a substitute for
good documentation; in no way is code alone its own documentation.</p>
<p>A good set of tests can, however, supplement documentation by showing how the code was expected
to behave at the time it was written. If you&rsquo;ve done things well, your tests are a set of inputs to
your code and corresponding sets of returned values, changed fields, mocked function calls, or other
expected side effects. That&rsquo;s a pretty good overview of what the code&rsquo;s supposed to do, or at least
the understanding of such at the time.</p>
<p>This of course only works if your tests all pass. Just like documentation, tests which fall out of
date and fail because they no longer match the expected behaviour are no longer useful - both as
a reference and otherwise.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, we&rsquo;d be holding tests to a similar level of scrutiny as
&ldquo;real&rdquo; code because they <em>are</em> real code. But this isn&rsquo;t an ideal world and I&rsquo;m just some person on
the internet, so you do you.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re dealing with mission-critical stuff - nuclear reactors, medical devices, airplanes, etc. - in which case you really should be quite thorough with checking your tests and your code, or at the very least better than certain events would seem to indicate.</p>

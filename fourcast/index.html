				<h1>Changelog</h1>

				<div class="row col-sm-12">
					<h2>v1.3 - 12 July 2016 <small>"Back to the Future."</small></h2>
					<p>Removed support for older OSes, fixed a crash bug, and dropped usage tracking.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Dropped support for Windows Phone 8 and below.</strong>

							<ul>
								<li>This version only supports Windows Phone 8.1 and above.

									<ul>
										<li>Older versions of Windows Phone will still be able to download and use v1.2, but will not
											receive updates moving forward.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Fixed an issue with special characters in tile names.</strong>

							<ul>
								<li>This was causing the app to crash when creating the tile.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Removed Google Analytics tracking.</strong></li>
					</ul>

				</div>

				<div class="row col-sm-12">
					<h2>v1.2 - 07 June 2014 <small>"...or not."</small></h2>
					<p>Another UI redesign, and long-overdue improvements to tiles.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>The forecast display has been redesigned.</strong>

							<ul>
								<li>The weather station name and map link is now above the forecast pivot.</li>
								<li>Each forecast element is now laid out horizontally, and their headers have been removed.</li>
								<li>Icons have been added for each state: hot/warm/cold/cool, clear/obscured/rain/snow, windy/still, and
									humid/arid.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Live tiles have been redesigned.</strong>

							<ul>
								<li>Tiles will appear the same on Windows Phone 7.5 and below, but with the new condition icons used
									instead.</li>
								<li>Windows Phone 7.8 and 8 users will now see all four pieces of
									forecast information on the tile: temperature, condition, humidity, and
									wind speed.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>The "tonight" pivot has been renamed to "today".</strong>

							<ul>
								<li>This more accurately reflects the nature of the forecast information
									displayed there; the actual data displayed has not been changed.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>The splash screen has been removed.</strong>

							<ul>
								<li>The app should take less time to launch now.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Rewrote the city/location search function.</strong>

							<ul>
								<li>As a side-effect, searching while a search is already in progress no longer crashes the app.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

				</div>

				<div class="row col-sm-12">
					<h2>v1.1.1 - 11 May 2014 <small>"Final call..."</small></h2>

				</div>

				<div class="row col-sm-12">
					<h2>v1.1 - 14 February 2014 <small>"Rebuild it up."</small></h2>
					<p>Architectural improvements, and a new way of getting weather data.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Switched from using Weather Underground's XML API to their JSON one.

							<ul>

							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Rewrote the way the app stores, handles, and retrieves settings.</li>

					<h2>v1.0 - 26 November 2013 <small>"Window cleaning."</small></h2>
					<p>A cleaner while still familiar main UI.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>No Forecast Loaded: No Forecast Loaded - No Forecast Loaded. <strong>No more.</strong>

							<ul>
								<li>Reduced the number of "No Forecast Loaded" messages that are displayed.

									<ul>
										<li>It really doesn't need to be displayed thrice.

											<ul>
												<li>Should've figured that one out earlier.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Centred and capitalised the headers above each forecast element.</li>
